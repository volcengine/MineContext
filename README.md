# 👋🏻 What is MineContext

MineContext is a proactive context-aware AI partner. By utilizing screenshots and content comprehension (with future support for multi-source multimodal information including documents, images, videos, code, and external application data), it can see and understand the user's digital world context. Based on an underlying contextual engineering framework, it actively delivers high-quality information such as insights, daily/weekly summaries, to-do lists, and activity records.

![feature.gif](src/feature.gif)



# 🚀 Key Features

MineContext focuses on four key features: effortless collection, intelligent resurfacing, proactive delivery, and a context engineering architecture.

1. 📥 Effortless Collection
   Capable of gathering and processing massive amounts of context. Designed storage management enables extensive collection without adding mental burden.
2. 🚀 Proactive Delivery
   Delivers key information and insights proactively in daily use. It extracts summarized content from your context—such as daily/weekly summaries, tips, and todos—and pushes them directly to your homepage.
3. 💡 Intelligent Resurfacing
   Surfaces relevant and useful context intelligently during creation. Ensures assisted creativity without overwhelming you with information.
4. 🎯 Context Engineering Architecture
   Supports the complete lifecycle of multimodal, multi-source data—from capture, processing, and storage to management, retrieval, and consumption—enabling the generation of six types of intelligent context.


# 🔏 Privacy Protection

##  Local-First
MineContext places a high priority on user privacy. By default, all data is stored locally in the following path to ensure your privacy and security.


```
~/Library/Application Support/MineContext/Data
```

## Local AI model 
In addition, we support custom model services based on the OpenAI API protocol. You can use fully local models in MineContext, ensuring that any data does not leave your local environment.

# 🏁 Quick Start

## 1. Installation

Click [Github Latest Release](https://github.com/volcengine/MineContext/releases) to Download

![Download APP](src/Download-App.gif)

## 2. Disable the quarantine attribute

Enter the following command in the terminal to disable the quarantine attribute before running the application.

```
sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/MineContext.app"
```

![Quarantine](src/Quarantine.gif)

## 3. Enter Your API Key

After the application launches, please follow the prompts to enter your API key. (Note: On the first run, the application needs to install the backend environment, which may take about two minutes).

We currently support services from Doubao, OpenAI, and custom models. This includes any **local models** or **third-party model** services that are compatible with the OpenAI API format.

We recommend using [LMStudio](https://lmstudio.ai/) to run local models. It provides a simple interface and powerful features to help you quickly deploy and manage them.

**Considering both cost and performance, we recommend using the Doubao model.** The Doubao API Key can be generated in the [API Management Interface](https://console.volcengine.com/ark/region:ark+cn-beijing/apiKey).

After obtaining the Doubao API Key, you need to activate two models in the [Model Activation Management Interface](https://console.volcengine.com/ark/region:ark+cn-beijing/model): the Visual Language Model and the Embedding Model.

- Visual Language Model: Doubao-Seed-1.6-flash
  ![doubao-vlm-model](src/doubao-vlm-model.png)

- Embedding Model: Doubao-embedding-large
  ![doubao-emb-model](src/doubao-emb-model.png)

The following is the filling process after obtaining the API Key:

![Enter API Key](src/Enter-API-Key.gif)

## 4. Start Recording

Enter 【Screen Monitor】 to enable the system permissions for screen sharing. After completing the setup, you need to restart the application for the changes to take effect.
![Enable-Permissions](src/Enable-Permissions.gif)

After restarting the application, please first set your screen sharing area in 【Settings】, then click [Start Recording] to begin taking screenshots.
![Screen-Settings](src/Screen-Settings.gif)

## 5. Forget it

After starting the recording, your context will gradually be collected. It will take some time to generate value. So, forget about it and focus on other tasks with peace of mind. MineContext will generate to-dos, prompts, summaries, and activities for you in the background. Of course, you can also engage in proactive Q&A through [Chat with AI].
Of course, here is the English translation of the provided text:

## 6. Backend Debugging

MineContext supports backend debugging, which can be accessed at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Core Architecture

The project follows a standard Electron architectural design, clearly separating the code for the main process, preload scripts, and renderer process to ensure security and maintainability.

```
frontend/
├── src/
│ ├── main/     # Electron main process (window management, lifecycle, IPC)
│ ├── preload/  # Preload script, securely bridging Node APIs and the renderer process
│ └── renderer/ # React frontend interface (renderer process)
│
├── packages/
│ └── shared/   # Common utilities, IPC channels, logging, and constant definitions
│
├── build/      # Build resources (icons, platform configurations)
├── dist/       # Build artifacts generated by electron-builder
├── externals/  # External dependencies (Python scripts, binaries, etc.)
├── resources/  # Static assets (icons, templates, images)
└── scripts/    # Development and build helper scripts
```

1.  **Main Process (`src/main/`) is responsible for:**

    - Managing application windows
    - Handling lifecycle events (startup, quit, activate)
    - Establishing secure IPC communication
    - Integrating with backend services (Python and system APIs)

2.  **Preload Script (`src/preload/`) is responsible for:**

    - Securely exposing Node.js APIs to the renderer process
    - Handling IPC communication with the main process
    - Implementing cross-process resource access

3.  **Renderer Process (`src/renderer/`) is responsible for:**

    - Implementing the user interface with React
    - Managing global state with Jotai and Redux
    - Utilizing an efficient styling system based on Tailwind CSS
    - Implementing dynamic loading and performance optimization mechanisms

4.  **Build and Packaging are responsible for:**

    - `electron-vite.config.ts` — Configures the build logic for both the main and renderer processes (aliases, plugins, etc.).
    - `electron-builder.yml` — Defines packaging and distribution configurations for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 💻 Frontend Usage

### Build Backend

Before starting frontend development, you need to build the backend first:

```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
./build.sh
```

### Install Dependencies

Due to package version issues, using a domestic PyPI mirror is not currently supported. Please run the following command to ensure you are using the original PyPI source:

```bash
pip config unset global.index-url
cd frontend
pnpm install
```

### Development and Debugging

During local development, it is normal for the screen capture area selection to be slow. Please wait, as this issue does not exist in the packaged application.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Application Packaging

To build APP for macOS:

```bash
pnpm build:mac
# Data Path
# ～/Library/Application\ Support/MineContext
```

The executable files generated by the packaging process will be stored in the `MineContext/frontend/dist` directory.

## 🚀 Backend Usage

### Installation

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast and reliable package management:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/volcengine/MineContext.git
cd MineContext

# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Sync dependencies (automatically creates virtual environment)
uv sync
```

### Configuration

1. **Basic Configuration** (`config/config.yaml`):

```yaml
server:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8765
  debug: false

embedding_model:
  provider: doubao # options: openai, doubao
  api_key: your-api-key
  model: doubao-embedding-large-text-240915

vlm_model:
  provider: doubao # options: openai, doubao
  api_key: your-api-key
  model: doubao-seed-1-6-flash-250828

capture:
  enabled: true
  screenshot:
    enabled: true # enable screenshot capture
    capture_interval: 5 # capture interval in seconds
```

2. **Prompt Templates** (`config/prompts_*.yaml`):
   - `prompts_en.yaml`: English prompt templates
   - `prompts_zh.yaml`: Chinese prompt templates

### Running the Server

```bash
# Start with default configuration
uv run opencontext start

# Start with custom config
uv run opencontext start --config /path/to/config.yaml

# Start with custom port (useful for avoiding conflicts)
uv run opencontext start --port 8000
```

**Available Options:**

- `--config`: Path to configuration file
- `--host`: Host address (default: from config or `localhost`)
- `--port`: Port number (default: from config or `8000`)

**Priority**: Command-line arguments > Config file > Default values

Alternatively, you can activate the virtual environment manually:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
opencontext start --port 8000
```

# 💎 The Philosophy Behind the Name

The naming of MineContext also reflects the team's ingenuity. It signifies both "my context" and "mining context." It draws inspiration from the core philosophy of Minecraft—openness, creativity, and exploration.

If vast amounts of context are like scattered "blocks," then MineContext provides a "world" where you can freely build, combine, and create. Users can reimagine and create new content based on the collected massive context and generate high-quality information.
