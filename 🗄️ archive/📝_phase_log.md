# Frontend Build Fix - 2025-10-17

**Objective**: Fix TypeScript casing errors in the frontend build.

**Phase Log**:

- **2025-10-17 05:13:23 UTC**: Phase initiated.
**Update (2025-10-17):**
The initial fix was incomplete. The build still fails with a `TS1149` error in `src/renderer/src/App.tsx`.

**Analysis**:
The file contains two imports for the same component with different casing:
- `import LoadingComponent from './components/Loading'`
- `import { BackendStatus } from './components/loading'`

The second import must be corrected to use the capitalized `Loading` to match the directory name and the other import.

**Next Step**: Re-delegate to `@technical-maestro` with specific instructions to fix the remaining casing issue.
- Read `frontend/src/renderer/src/App.tsx` to identify the incorrect import.
- Fixed the import casing for `BackendStatus` from `'./components/loading'` to `'./components/Loading'`.
- Verified the fix in `frontend/src/renderer/src/App.tsx`.
